   *  timebounds: await StellarSdk.Server.fetchTimebounds(100)

   *  // normally we would need to call setTimeout here, but setting timebounds
   *  // earlier does the trick!
   *  .build();
   * ```
   * @argument {number} seconds Number of seconds past the current time to wait.
   * @argument {bool} [_isRetry=false] True if this is a retry. Only set this internally!
   * This is to avoid a scenario where Horizon is horking up the wrong date.

   * your amounts were rounded down to zero). So treat the just-submitted offer
