# She-Help
She-Help enables female youth to receive financing for their business ideas based on their merit and financial literacy using a secure, blockchain-enabled system


## Inspiration
The 21st century has been largely characterized by an innovation race, but the reality is that it might not be possible to launch a small business without qualifying for financing. She-Help seeks to financially support and  educate female youth entrepreneurs, empowering them to realize their dreams.


## What it does
She-Help enables female youth to receive financing for their business ideas based on their merit and financial literacy using a secure, blockchain-enabled system. It also provides a platform for continued development by offering courses in areas such as budgeting, taxes, branding and more. Users will be engaged with interactive features such as a Twilio chatbot that sends a "Question of the Week"!


## How we built it
The team designed wireframes using adobe-xd to help users envision their workflow and experience. The blockchain transaction proof-of-concept was built by using an html/css front-end and node js server that communicates with the Stellar Blockchain. The chatbot is powered by Twilio.

## What's next for She-Help
The team would love to build out the functionality of a facial recognition software to further improve the security of the platform, and research more about how to provide relevant development materials to the young female entrepreneurs. Our team would especially love to work further upon this project and develop end-to-end applications for the agencies and the aspiring entrepreneurs to increase it's usability and handiness.
