# She-Help
She-Help enables female youth to receive financing for their business ideas based on their merit and financial literacy using a secure, blockchain-enabled system


## Inspiration
The 21st century has been largely characterized by an innovation race, but the reality is that it might not be possible to launch a small business without qualifying for financing. She-Help seeks to financially support and  educate female youth entrepreneurs, empowering them to realize their dreams.


## What it does
She-Help enables female youth to receive financing for their business ideas based on their merit and financial literacy using a secure, blockchain-enabled system. It also provides a platform for continued development by offering courses in areas such as budgeting, taxes, branding and more. Users will be engaged with interactive features such as a Twilio chatbot that sends a "Question of the Week"!


## How we built it
The team designed wireframes using adobe-xd to help users envision their workflow and experience. The blockchain transaction proof-of-concept was built by using an html/css front-end and node js server that communicates with the Stellar Blockchain. The chatbot is powered by Twilio.


## Technologies Used
1. Adobe-xd
2. CSS
3. Html
4. Javascript
5. Photoshop
6. Twilio
7. Blockchain

## What's next for She-Help
The team would love to build out the functionality of a facial recognition software to further improve the security of the platform, and research more about how to provide relevant development materials to the young female entrepreneurs.
